## Guidlines

  Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.

  The game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display at least 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a even lower star rating (down to 1).

  If the number of moves reached to 20 so the player will lose 1 star and son on

  When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
  
  The player has restart button to restart the game.

## How the game works
  The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match! 
- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
